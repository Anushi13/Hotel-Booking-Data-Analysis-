# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis-
In this project, I have attempted to analyze a hotel booking dataset and come up with some relevant conclusions about the factors that contribute to high cancellation rates of bookings. No personal information of customer is provided in this dataset.

ðŸ“– Problem Statement
A dataset containing 119390 records across 32 features has been given with information regarding bookings of two hotels from July 2015 to August 2017. These two hotels are City Hotel and Resort Hotel.

The main objective is to explore the given dataset and discover the factors which govern the bookings. The dataset will be analyzed and from the conclusions drawn from it will be used to recognize the missteps taken by the manager. With this information, hotels will be equipped to improve their performance.

Data analysis is performed to answer the following questions:

What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
How will hotel be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

ðŸ“– Hypothesis

More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
When there is a longer waiting list,customer tend to cancel more frequently.
The majority  of clients are coming from offline travel agends to make their reservations.
